     - YAML: `soc2_2017_with_rev_2022.yaml` and `soc2-2017.yaml`
   - **Controls**: 377 total controls, 301 assessable
   - **Trust Service Criteria Coverage**:
     - CC (Common Criteria/Security): 272 controls
     - A (Availability): 20 controls
     - C (Confidentiality): 9 controls
     - PI (Processing Integrity): 1 control
     - P (Privacy): 73 controls

2. **HITRUST Framework**
   - ❌ **Status**: Not present - needs to be created
   - **Action Required**: Complete framework implementation

## Detailed Analysis

### SOC 2 Type 2 Framework

#### Completeness Assessment
The SOC 2 framework appears to have comprehensive coverage of all five Trust Service Criteria. However, some minor issues were identified:

1. Some control numbering appears non-standard (e.g., "PP1.1" instead of "P1.1" for Privacy)
2. Processing Integrity (PI) shows only 1 control, which may indicate incomplete coverage
3. Confidentiality controls start at C6.5.1, suggesting earlier controls may be missing

#### Recommendations for SOC 2
1. Review control numbering against official AICPA SOC 2 2017 TSC documentation
2. Verify all Processing Integrity controls are included
3. Check for any missing Confidentiality controls (C1-C6.4)
4. Ensure 2022 revision points of focus are properly documented
5. Validate all control descriptions match official documentation

### HITRUST Framework

#### Current Status
- No HITRUST framework files exist in the repository
- Neither Excel source files nor YAML definitions are present

#### Implementation Plan for HITRUST

1. **Create Excel Template** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Use the provided template structure
   - Include all 14 HITRUST control categories
   - Follow CISO Assistant formatting conventions

2. **Control Categories to Include**:
   - 01: Information Security Management Program
   - 02: Organizational
   - 03: Human Resources Security
   - 04: Asset Management
   - 05: Access Control
   - 06: Cryptography
   - 07: Physical and Environmental Security
   - 08: Operations Security
   - 09: Communications Security
   - 10: System Development and Maintenance
   - 11: Supplier Relationships
   - 12: Information Security Incident Management
   - 13: Business Continuity Management
   - 14: Compliance

3. **Required Sheets in Excel**:
   - library_content (metadata)
   - requirements (controls)
   - reference_controls
   - scores (implementation levels)
   - implementation_groups
   - risk_matrix

4. **Conversion Process**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ciso-assistant-community/tools
   python3 convert_library.py hitrust/HITRUST_CSF_v11.xlsx
   ```

5. **Deployment**:
   - Move generated YAML to `backend/library/libraries/`
   - Test in CISO Assistant application

## Master Control Points (MCPs)

### SOC 2 MCPs
- The current SOC 2 implementation uses the standard control hierarchy
- No specific MCP mappings were identified
- Consider adding MCPs for cross-framework mapping capabilities

### HITRUST MCPs
- Will need to be defined during implementation
- Should align with HITRUST's control structure
- Consider mapping to other frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST, etc.)

## Action Items

### Immediate Actions (Priority: HIGH)
1. Verify SOC 2 control completeness against official documentation
2. Create HITRUST Excel template with all controls
3. Begin populating HITRUST controls from official documentation

### Short-term Actions (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. Fix any identified gaps in SOC 2 controls
2. Convert HITRUST Excel to YAML format
3. Test both frameworks in CISO Assistant
4. Create MCP mappings between frameworks

### Long-term Actions (Priority: LOW)
1. Create cross-framework mappings (SOC 2 ↔ HITRUST)
2. Add additional metadata and evidence requirements
3. Develop automated validation scripts
4. Document best practices for framework maintenance

## Resources Needed

1. **Documentation**:
   - Official AICPA SOC 2 2017 TSC (with 2022 revision)
   - HITRUST CSF v11 documentation
   - CISO Assistant framework development guide

2. **Tools**:
   - Excel for creating/editing framework files
   - Python with required packages (openpyxl, PyYAML)
   - CISO Assistant test environment

3. **Time Estimate**:
   - SOC 2 verification and fixes: 4-6 hours
   - HITRUST framework creation: 16-24 hours
   - Testing and validation: 8-12 hours
   - Total estimated effort: 28-42 hours

## Conclusion

The SOC 2 Type 2 framework is largely complete but requires minor verification and potential adjustments. The HITRUST framework needs to be created from scratch following the CISO Assistant conventions. Both frameworks will benefit from comprehensive testing and validation once the implementation is complete.
